# Project-Management-React
> A Simple Project and Task-tracking frontend application built in React.

## Project Description

Hello World,

This is a practice React project, which I built while I was learning React on one of the Udemy courses - ‘React - The Complete Guide 2023 (incl. React Router & Redux)’ by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.

The primary goal of this practice project was to help understand the fundamental concepts of React like functional components, use of props, refs, concepts like forward ref, prop drilling, and some important React hooks like `useState`, `useRef` etc. This project helps a lot in understanding how data can be passed around between components using props, as well as using refs and callback functions between components to control different parts of the application.

## Context API Branch

Although during the time of this project walkthrough in the course, the context API in react (or any sort of centralized state management tool) was not covered yet. Hence you will see a lot of prop drilling between components to pass around the app's state data. However, after I completed learning the context API, I restructured the project code to use the context API and make it easy to manage the state without the issue of prop drilling covering all of the JSX code. To check the second version of the project which I have created using the context API on the other branch named **context-api**.

## Future Objective
My next objectives will be to rewrite the project using some other cool features in React to learn more about them such as,
- [ ] Using Redux.
- [ ] Adding data persistence using IndexedDB and Local Storage.
