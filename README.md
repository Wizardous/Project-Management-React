# Project-Management-React
> A Simple Project and Task-tracking frontend application built in React.

## Project Description

Hello World,

This is a practice React project, which I built while I was learning React on one of the Udemy courses - ‘React - The Complete Guide 2023 (incl. React Router & Redux)’ by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.

The primary goal of this practice project was to help understand the fundamental concepts of React like functional components, use of props, refs, concepts like forward ref, prop drilling, and some important React hooks like `useState`, `useRef` etc. This project helps a lot in understanding how data can be passed around between components using props, as well as using refs and callback functions between components to control different parts of the application.

## This is Prop-Drill Branch
If you are reading this, then that means you are currently checking out the prop-drill branch of this repository. This is the archive of the original code, when developed without the use of any context API methods. All the data passed between components is using Props and use of callback function props to update application state. 

The main branch will have whichever latest updates were added to the project like using Context-API, Redux, etc. The main branch will be archived to a different branch before upgrading the project with new features, to preserve the old states of the projects with old set of features or functionalities.
